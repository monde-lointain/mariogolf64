# Mario Golf 64 decomp sprint retros

One short digest per sprint, newest first, written at the `/sprint-review` gate. This is
the *consolidated* record so lessons compound across sprints (McConnell, *More Effective
Agile*, Ch.19: retros must change behavior). The PO promotes durable lessons into the memory
dir manually — the review gate does not auto-write memory.

Process/tooling edits are **retro-gated**: the "Suggested workflow improvements" the
execution loop records into `SPRINT.md` are applied here, at review, not mid-sprint (see
`CLAUDE.md ## Scrum operating model`). The `Applied:` line below is the audit trail of which
numbered suggestions the PO accepted.

## Entry format

```
## Sprint N — <goal> — <date>
- Increment: <files banked> / <functions matched> (delta: <pct before → after>)
- Quality: <stuck-far>/<permuter>/<carried>/<re-opened> this sprint
- What helped: <levers / upstream-mirrors / tools that worked>
- Friction: <what slowed it down>
- Applied: <PO-selected, N of M: #1 … #k …; (#j … NOT selected)>
- Carry-over: <spiked files + blocking function>
```

## Sprint 2 — bank osCreateMesgQueue as src/libultra/monegi/message/createmesgqueue.c — 2026-06-11
- Increment: 1 file banked / 1 fn matched (delta: ~0.48% → ~0.53%; md5-candidate files 8→9)
- Quality: 0/0/0/0 (stuck-far/permuter/carried/re-opened) — clean verbatim-upstream singleton; goal met first pass
- What helped: the upstream-mirror path (verbatim single-fn `createmesgqueue.c`, `monegi/` `<PR/x.h>` includes resolved unchanged, no clang-format); **recovering the unsymbolized `__osThreadTail` data global's vram deterministically from the target fn's own asm** (`lui 0x800d`/`addiu -0x7de0` = 0x800C8220) instead of an RE hunt — turned the one risky enabler into a lookup; the `/sprint-plan` gate build-check (`make extract && make`) validated the flip + symbol add green before the execution middle
- Friction: minimal. Candidate triage was the only real work — the two smaller-ranked leaves (`guRandom` function-local `static .data` placement risk + missing `guint.h`; `alCopy`/`alHeapInit` bare `<libaudio.h>` not resolvable without `-I include/libultra/PR`) were de-prioritized in favor of the clean `monegi/message/` mirror
- Applied: 3 of 3 — #1 codified "harvest an unsymbolized data global's addr from the target fn's own `lui/addiu`" into CLAUDE.md's upstream-mirror branch; #2 include-resolvability hazard note (audio band `<libaudio.h>` needs `-I include/libultra/PR`; prefer `<PR/x.h>` upstreams) in the upstream-mirror convention; #3 documented the `symbol_addrs.txt` data-extern format (`name = 0x<vram>; // size:0x<n>`, no `type:func`)
- Carry-over: none

## Sprint 1 — bank __osDpDeviceBusy as src/libultra/monegi/rdp/dp.c — 2026-06-11
- Increment: 1 file banked / 1 fn matched (delta: 0.43% → ~0.48%; md5-candidate files 7→8)
- Quality: 0/0/0/0 (stuck-far/permuter/carried/re-opened) — the function itself was a trivial verbatim-upstream leaf
- What helped: the upstream-mirror path (`/decomp-libupstream`, verbatim 12-line `dp.c`, clean leaf, no new symbols); the `/sprint-plan` gate build-check surfaced the real blocker before the execution middle; **systematic root-cause investigation** (bisecting the `cpp|as` asm pipeline) instead of accepting the surface "next is static" symptom
- Friction: a system-wide **missing `mips-linux-gnu-cpp`** regression (toolchain removed since the 2026-05-22 green build) made the `cpp|as` pipe — which lacked `pipefail` — silently emit 0-byte asm objects for all 256 files, surfacing as a *misleading* `undefined reference to next` at link. Consumed most of the session to root-cause. A stale `build/.z64` also false-positived its SHA-1 mid-debug. Fixed by reinstalling `cpp-mips-linux-gnu`.
- Applied: 3 of 3 — #1 Makefile loud-fail guard (`.SHELLFLAGS` pipefail + missing-`$(CPP)` `$(error)`); #2 stale-ROM SHA guard (CLAUDE.md finalization doctrine — gate `sha1sum` on `make` success); #3 codified the `/sprint-plan` gate build-check as load-bearing (CLAUDE.md DoR)
- Also landed (PO directive, not a buffered suggestion): workflow-doctrine change — yaml subseg flips/splits + `symbol_addrs.txt` additions + the follow-on `make extract` are now **agent** actions (was USER), performed at the gate after PO scope approval; safety rails preserved (never-delete, disjoint-from-`ghidra_symbols`, `mariogolf64.ld`/segment-structure off-limits).
- Carry-over: none
