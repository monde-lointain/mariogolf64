# /sprint-plan — the plan gate

SCOPE = `$ARGUMENTS`

<role>
You are the planning gate of the lightweight Scrum loop (see `## Scrum operating model` and
`## Execution loop` in `CLAUDE.md`). Propose one sprint's worth of work, get the Product Owner's
approval, then perform and validate the enablers, and write `SPRINT.md`. Then hand off to the inline
execution loop. Keep it cheap — this is triage, not decompilation.
</role>

<scope>
This gate reads `BACKLOG.md` and ranks candidates with `tools/pick_target.py`; performs the gate
enablers — edits `mariogolf64.yaml` (subseg flip/split/path-qualifier lines only) and
`symbol_addrs.txt` (add-only), optionally `make sync-names` to refresh curated names — runs
`make extract && make` to validate, and writes `SPRINT.md`. It does not edit `src/`,
`ghidra_symbols.txt` (except via `make sync-names`), or `mariogolf64.ld`.
</scope>

<steps>

## Step 0 — Validate argument

If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty, anchor-check against `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$`. On mismatch, abort:

```
/sprint-plan: arg `$ARGUMENTS` does not match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$`. Aborting.
```

Empty `$ARGUMENTS` is valid — plan from the whole active phase.

## Step 1 — Rank the candidates

Read `BACKLOG.md` (active phase, carry-overs first, enabler items), then rank the live candidates
smallest-first:

```bash
venv/bin/python3 tools/pick_target.py -n 12        # add `--lib <scope>` when $ARGUMENTS is set
```

The table gives, per candidate: `func`, `rom`, `vram`, `size`, `nfns`, `pts`, `kind`
(`asm-flip` | `c-stub`), `upstream` (libultra|libkmc|libnusys|none), `band` (warm|cold), and
`hazards`. Each hazard maps to a `docs/hazards.md` section via the hazard index in `CLAUDE.md` —
read the matching section when you plan around one.

## Step 2 — Optional name refresh (gate-only)

If the chosen candidate shows as `func_<VRAM>` and Ghidra has a name for it, refresh once here:

```bash
make sync-names    # Ghidra → ghidra_symbols.txt; gate-only, never mid-sprint
```

A rename breaks in-flight links until `make extract && make`, so keep this at the gate. Skip it when
the name is already curated.

## Step 3 — Refine the slice (lightweight DoR)

Pick the smallest coherent increment, in this order of preference:

1. A carry-over from `BACKLOG.md` being retried (its spike blocker resolved).
2. The smallest candidate from `pick_target.py` — one `src/<seg>.c` taken to zero `INCLUDE_ASM`
   stubs (an `asm-flip` candidate, or a `c-stub` file's remaining functions).
3. One cohesive subseg cluster when the file is part of a multi-file pack (split into singletons at
   the upstream-file boundary).

Drop `hasm`-permanent subsegs and data-dominant units (a table-authoring task, not a code loop). A
candidate whose upstream has a file-scope `static` (the `file-static` hazard) routes to the classical
loop, not the upstream mirror (see `docs/hazards.md#file-static-bss-layout-conflict`). Per surviving
candidate note: subseg type (`c` or needs-flip), upstream-mirror availability, and hazards.

Cap small. Sprint 1 (and until a per-sprint count emerges) = 1 file or ≤ ~3–4 functions, so the
autonomous middle fits a context window. Span multiple files only when siblings (same upstream
source, or one pack split).

## Step 4 — Identify the gate enablers

List the enablers the chosen increment needs (the agent performs these in Step 7, after the PO
approves): flip the subseg (`asm` → `c`); split a multi-file pack at the upstream-file boundary; add
the target's curated name to `symbol_addrs.txt` (add-only). The name comes from the
`pick_target.py` table / the upstream source — no MCP lookup at this gate. If a `refs-unplaced` or
`calls-unplaced` hazard is flagged, the symbol recovery is a gate enabler too — follow
`docs/hazards.md#recover-extern-refs-unplaced` / `#calls-unplaced-function-callee-dual`.

## Step 5 — Propose the sprint goal (Commander's Intent)

Write the goal vividly (2–4 lines): what banking this file/cluster means, the seed/upstream path to
try first, and the explicit success predicate — *"every fn inlined (0 INCLUDE_ASM stubs) + full
`make` ROM SHA-1 == baserom + committed; `src/<seg>.c` flips to md5-candidate."* Snapshot match
progress as the pre-sprint baseline (matched count + md5-candidate file count + date, from `git log`
+ a `pick_target.py` count).

## Step 5b — Estimate the sprint (story points) + the 8-point gate

Story-point velocity is live — the v1 seed everyday, plus the v2 realized tier on the classical
track since Sprint 11 (mirror sprints stay seed-only). Fibonacci 1,2,3,5,8,13, current
`regime: mirror`. See `VELOCITY.md` for the rules + anchors. For the chosen increment:

1. **Seed** = the `pts` column from the Step 1 table (deterministic). For a cluster, the committed
   seed is the sum of its files' `pts`. A `blk` seed = an un-pickable needs-header (a DoR reject) —
   swap the increment, do not commit it.
2. **8-point gate.** A committed 8 or 13 must not run as a normal 1-increment sprint — decompose it
   (split the subseg at the upstream-file/function boundary) or pull a scaffolding enabler as the
   sprint goal instead. This prevents an all-or-nothing bank stall. (Expect this gate to fire once
   the mirror band is mined out and classical units dominate.)
3. **Adjust** (optional, ±1 ladder step) by comparing the increment's profile to the `VELOCITY.md`
   anchor rows. This is the committed estimate, surfaced to the PO in Step 6. A mirror increment has
   no freeze commit (seed-only, re-derivable), logged to `VELOCITY.md` at `/sprint-review`. A
   classical/mixed increment uses the v2 two-pass freeze (commit the plan-time seed before `src/`,
   realized in a second commit) — see `VELOCITY.md`.

## Step 6 — PO approval gate

Present the proposed goal + committed backlog (the increment, its enablers, the upstream path, the
snapshot) + the committed story-point estimate (seed → adjusted; whether the 8-gate fired) to the PO
with `AskUserQuestion`: approve as-is / edit the goal / swap the increment. Do not proceed past this
gate until the PO approves. On approval, the agent performs the enablers in Step 7.

## Step 7 — Perform + validate the flip at the gate

Once the PO approves, perform the enablers, then confirm the scaffold still builds the real ROM:

1. **Add the symbol** (only if the target's curated name isn't already in
   `ghidra_symbols.txt`/`symbol_addrs.txt`): append `<curated_name> = 0x<vram>; // type:func` to
   `symbol_addrs.txt` (add-only). This must land before `make extract` so splat scaffolds the
   curated name, not `func_<VRAM>`.
2. **Flip the subseg** in `mariogolf64.yaml`: `[0x<off>, asm]` → `[0x<off>, c, <path>]` (split a
   multi-file pack at the upstream-file boundary first, if needed).
3. **Validate**:

   ```bash
   make extract && make
   ```

   The build must end `build/mariogolf64.z64: OK` and `sha1sum build/mariogolf64.z64` must equal
   `e2c4e7a905b29529b49a1619a401fe699224829b` (now with the new `INCLUDE_ASM` stubs). Confirm the
   scaffold stub is named the curated name, not `func_<VRAM>`. If it fails, the flip is bad (wrong
   offset, or a non-16-aligned subseg — see `docs/hazards.md#non16align`); fix it before writing
   DoR-ok. This catches a bad flip at the gate, not mid-sprint.

## Step 8 — Write SPRINT.md and hand off

On a green validation, write `SPRINT.md` (gitignored — ephemeral scratch + resume surface). Then run
the `## Execution loop` (`CLAUDE.md`) inline over the committed backlog — one function at a time, no
per-function PO stop. Each banked function appends a standup line + its suggestion buffer to
`SPRINT.md` and applies no tooling edits (those wait for the retro). Run `/sprint-review` when every
committed item is banked or spiked/carried.

<example>
A completed `SPRINT.md` for a single recover-extern mirror sprint:

```markdown
# Sprint 41 — bank __osEPiRawWriteIo (libultra pi IO_WRITE mirror)

## Goal (Commander's Intent)
Bank `__osEPiRawWriteIo` into `src/libultra/nintendo/pi/epirawwrite.c` — a verbatim IO_WRITE
mirror in the warm pi band. Recover the macro-hidden `__osCurrentHandle` extract before the flip,
copy upstream verbatim, prove via full-make ROM SHA-1.
Success: 0 INCLUDE_ASM stubs in the file + ROM SHA-1 == baserom + committed → md5-candidate.

## Committed backlog
- [ ] src/libultra/nintendo/pi/epirawwrite.c  (1 fn, ~120 instrs, upstream: libultra)  DoR: ok (flip validated)
- [x] enabler (agent, at gate): symbol_addrs += __osCurrentHandle = 0x800C7E90; // size:0x8 — recovered from lui/lo16, validated

## Estimate (story points)
committed 2pt  (seed 2 from pts → adjusted 2; 8-gate: clear; regime: mirror)

## DoR notes
- subseg: flipped; upstream: libultra/nintendo/pi/epirawwrite; hazards: macro-hidden recover-extern (EPI_SYNC → __osCurrentHandle)

## Pre-sprint snapshot
matched 312/1180 fns (26.4%); md5-candidate files 47/130   (2026-06-13)

## Standup log
(execution appends: <fn> — <Match|stuck-far|spiked> — next)

## Suggestion buffer (recorded, applied at /sprint-review — NOT mid-sprint)
(the execution loop appends its numbered "Suggested workflow improvements" here)
```
